## About Non-Terrestrial Networks

Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) are advanced communication systems that extend beyond traditional terrestrial infrastructures. They include satellite networks, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) communications, and other high-altitude platforms. NTNs play a crucial role in providing connectivity in remote areas, supporting disaster recovery, and enabling global communication networks. With the rapid advancements in technology, NTNs are becoming integral to our connected world, offering new opportunities for innovation and development in the field of telecommunications.
